# create a fastapi service with python that reads and writes data from redis cache.........if someone post 
# data to an endpoint we want to take that data an store it in a redis cache, 
# if someone hits the endpoint with a get request we want to return data from redis cache, 
# create metrics to measure the performance of the service....how long it takes the service to 
# read and write from the cache(how fast), how long each request takes

# export grafana metrics using prometheus

# THINGS TO LEARN
# ===============
# -read and write data from redis cache
# -api's and end pointsmetrics with grafana
